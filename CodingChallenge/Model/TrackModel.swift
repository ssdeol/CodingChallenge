/// This is the model for Track. It will have 3 fields: trackName: - Song Name, trackArtistName - Artist Name and trackAlbumName - Song Album, trackAlbumArt - Album art. This class implements the Codable protocol. Which is used to call the JSONDecoder. JSONDecoder will automatically parse the data returned from the API call for the feilds specified in the TrackKeys and initialize the Track Model with that data. Because we are only using the 'GET' call, we only need to decode the incoming data so only the decoder func is being used.
