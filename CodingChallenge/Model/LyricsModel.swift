/// This is the model for Lyrics. It will have 3 fields: name: - Song Name, artistName - Artist Name and songLyrics - Song Lyrics. This class implements the Codable protocol. Which is used to call the JSONDecoder. JSONDecoder will automatically parse the data returned from the API call for the feilds specified in the LyricsKeys and initialize the Lyrics Model with that data. Because we are only using the 'GET' call, we only need to decode the incoming data so only the decoder func is being used.
